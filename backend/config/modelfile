      "Optional_Notes":"This session emphasizes horizontal pressing movements to target the chest and vertical pressing to develop the shoulders. Because the program involves a high volume of pressing exercises, there is a strong focus on face pulls to ensure balanced shoulder development\u2014specifically targeting the rear delts and traps. This balance is crucial for maintaining shoulder health and preventing imbalances that can lead to injury. By the end of the workout, the chest, shoulders, and triceps will have been thoroughly worked, receiving a heavy training stimulus to drive growth and strength.\n\nThe triceps receive ample stimulation through the pressing movements, so isolated tricep work is unnecessary. Adding direct tricep exercises could hinder chest recovery, especially since the two compound presses performed during the session already provide sufficient triceps activation."

Given the two compound pressing exercises, face pulls are included to support shoulder health by strengthening the rear delts and traps, helping to maintain balance and prevent injury. The session then continues with focused work on the biceps and rear delts\u2014important for supporting pressing movements and ensuring well-rounded shoulder development."

      "Optional_Notes":"The last session of the week is a full-body day, designed to complement the program while addressing the lower body\u2014one of the weaker areas\u2014without dedicating a separate leg day, as lower body has a low priority in this program. Reverse lunges are included to effectively stimulate the quads, glutes, and hamstrings.\n\nFor the chest, this day features accessory work such as chest flies, along with a horizontal pressing movement using bodyweight push-ups. Since compound chest exercises were the focus in the previous session, these accessories provide additional but less intense chest stimulation.\n\nFace pulls are included again to maintain shoulder health, especially important given that chest is trained on three separate days throughout the week.\n\nThere is only one direct triceps isolation exercise in the entire week, and it is placed on this final day. This placement is intentional because the triceps receive substantial activation during compound chest presses, and isolating them too much could interfere with chest recovery. Since push-ups are less demanding than heavy compound presses and this day mainly focuses on accessory chest work, adding minimal triceps isolation here allows for some direct triceps stimulus without compromising recovery. Overall, triceps volume is kept very low to prioritize chest development."

      "Optional_Notes":"This session initiates the training week with a strong emphasis on foundational compound movements and upper-body pulling. \nThe use of barbell or Smith machine squats delivers a heavy quad and glute stimulus, while the inclusion of rack or block pulls allows for high-volume upper back and trap development without over-fatiguing the lower back. \nWeighted pull-ups and close grip bench press serve as efficient compound upper-body movements that load the biceps, lats, chest, and triceps. Accessory work like band shrugs and face pulls target traps and rear delts to round out shoulder development. Decline push-ups provide a chest-focused finisher with a bodyweight hypertrophy stimulus, while band curls and hyperextensions support arm and posterior chain growth respectively. Neck curls\/extensions and band calf raises contribute to the program\u2019s aesthetic focus on neck and lower leg thickness, and the entire session maintains a well-balanced mix of anterior\/posterior loading with manageable fatigue."

      "Optional_Notes":"The second training day shifts the emphasis slightly toward posterior chain and core development. \nDeficit deadlifts are a central lift here, promoting deeper range hip extension and hamstring recruitment. Bench press introduces more traditional horizontal pressing volume, complementing the close grip bench from Day 1. Plate lunges add unilateral quad and glute work without introducing excess systemic fatigue. Upper body pulling volume remains high through weighted chin-ups and ring rows, which provide both vertical and horizontal pull variations. Wrist curls are incorporated mid-session to ensure forearm and grip development are not neglected. This day also includes a dense amount of core and neck volume, with hanging leg raises, crunches, and neck side raises working in tandem to build midline stability and neck thickness. Band shrugs and band good mornings continue the trap and lower back work in a lower-intensity fashion, and band calf raises provide another dose of calf stimulus without high CNS cost."

      "Optional_Notes":"The final session of the week is built around the heavy deadlift and overhead press combination, both of which place substantial demands on the entire body and nervous system. \nThis day is carefully constructed to avoid unnecessary overlap with earlier sessions by limiting deadlift volume and following with pause squats to provide quad stimulus without taxing the spine. Overhead pressing fills the vertical push gap, reinforcing deltoid and triceps development. Ring push-ups and ring rows are bodyweight-based accessories that encourage scapular control and core stability while further supporting chest and back volume. Arm isolation is continued with behind-the-head band triceps extensions and DB or cable curls, allowing elbow-friendly hypertrophy without excessive stress. Core, neck, and calves are again addressed at the end of the session with leg raises, band calf raises, and neck curls\/extensions. The week closes with a balanced, moderately intense full-body session that completes the program\u2019s volume targets without compromising recovery."

      "Optional_Notes":"Monday is designated as an upper body focus day, primarily targeting the shoulders, chest, and the long head of the triceps. Additionally, the upper back, neck, and abs are included, as a thick neck is a priority for the desired physique. On this day, the session begins with bench press, dips, or weighted push-ups, with the selection based on individual preference, performed for 4 sets of 4 to 8 repetitions. Immediately following this exercise, transition to pullovers, for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. This combination targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders extensively, along with the lats, and contributes to ribcage expansion, a characteristic of the physique.\n\nFollowing this, barbell or dumbbell overhead press is performed for further shoulder development, consisting of 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. For additional upper back and lat work, the program includes weighted chin-ups, for 3 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions, or supinated inverse rows for as many reps as possible, with the choice dependent on the individual's advancement level (weighted chin-ups for advanced, supinated rows without weight for others). The selection between these two options will influence the extent of upper back development and the overall appearance.\n\nThe session concludes with a series of exercises: diamond push-ups, behind-the-head triceps extensions, neck curls, and plank. These exercises provide a comprehensive finish for the chest and triceps, specifically targeting the long head of the triceps, and ensure training for the neck and core. Any variation of planks or sit-ups can be incorporated for abdominal training, which is a daily requirement for achieving the target physique."

Following this initial exercise, immediately move to single-leg calf raises.\n\nThe next sequence of exercises includes either Zercher or SSB (Safety Squat Bar) good mornings and weighted pull-ups. The selection between these can be both or just one, but the choice is contingent on the preceding exercise. If barbell rows were performed previously, good mornings are the logical follow-up to complement upper back work. If deadlifts were performed, weighted pull-ups should follow to engage the upper body without another knee flexion movement. The option to perform both good mornings and weighted pull-ups is viable for individuals with higher work capacity, typically if the preceding exercise was barbell rows. Individuals running this program are assumed to have sufficient experience to make informed choices regarding these selections. After this, immediately transition to leg raises for as many repetitions as possible.\n\nThe session concludes with hyperextensions, 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, followed immediately by supinated finger curls, 4 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions, neck curls, and dumbbell curls for additional bicep work. The presence of multiple exercises in sequence signifies that these should be performed continuously without rest between them. This final sequence effectively targets the lower back, hamstrings, glutes, forearms, neck, and biceps, completing the day's training."

      "Optional_Notes":"Friday's session, while often perceived as purely an arm day, involves a more complex training structure primarily targeting the biceps, triceps, and forearms, with secondary engagement of the chest, shoulders, and lats.\n\nThe session begins with your choice of barbell or EZ-bar curls, 4 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This is followed by skull crushers, 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, and then dumbbell rows, 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. This initial sequence effectively targets the upper arms and back.\n\nNext, incorporate a close-grip bench press as the compound movement for the day, or opt for diamond push-ups based on individual preference. Following this, perform hammer curls for forearm and bicep development. After hammer curls, perform hanging knee raises for ab work. This section provides additional chest and triceps development, along with some arm work.\n\nThe final exercises for the day begin with a choice between a dumbbell overhead press, 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, or decline push-ups. This choice allows for an informed decision based on whether more chest work is desired, fewer compound movements, or a preference for calisthenics over weightlifting. After this, perform finger curls for additional forearm work, consisting of 3 sets of 8-15 repetitions. Conclude the session with neck curls. Neck training should incorporate various types of flexion and extension to ensure all angles are targeted, serving as a placeholder for comprehensive neck development. Similarly, any abdominal exercise can be chosen for core training, which is consistently emphasized in the program."

      "Optional_Notes":"The final training day is designated as a leg day, though its placement in the weekly schedule can be flexible, provided the prescribed rest periods between sessions are maintained. While some leg involvement occurred on Wednesday, this session is primarily focused on direct leg training. Legs are not entirely neglected but are not the primary focus of the program; leg exercises are structured to also contribute to upper back development.\n\nThe session begins with either deadlifts or Zercher\/SSB squats. The choice between these two exercises is left to the individual's preference, with Zercher squats noted for significant core and upper back engagement. Multiple options are provided to accommodate individual preference. Weekly alternation between these primary exercises is recommended for balanced development, ensuring both deadlifts and knee flexion movements (squats) are included. Immediately following the primary exercise, perform shrugs for as many repetitions as possible (AMRAP) for 3 sets, utilizing dumbbells and squeezing until muscle failure in the traps.\n\nThe subsequent exercise is either pause squats, 3 sets of 4 repetitions, or block pulls, 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. The selection for this set is contingent upon the preceding primary exercise, similar to Wednesday's structure. For instance, if deadlifts were performed, pause squats are recommended to avoid repetitive pulling. If a squat variation was performed, block pulls are suggested to include a pulling movement rather than another knee flexion. This choice should be made based on the individual's current needs. Following this, perform pullovers, 3 sets of as many repetitions as possible (AMRAP). These are intended to be performed with an easy weight, focusing on a pump to promote blood flow and aid recovery, complementing the heavier pullovers on Monday.\n\nThe day concludes with face pulls, 4 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions, followed by dumbbell leg raises, 4 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions, lateral raises, 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions, and calf raises, 4 sets of 10-15 repetitions. This sequence provides additional work for the shoulders, core, and calves, completing the program."

      "Optional_Notes":"The first exercise of the session is either Farmer\u2019s Carries or Rack\/Block Pulls\u2014both highly effective for developing the traps and adding mass to your upper back. Farmer\u2019s Carries are more taxing on the entire system, engaging the grip, core, and upper body while also challenging cardiovascular endurance. On the other hand, Rack or Block Pulls focus more on the upper back and traps with less involvement from the posterior chain, since the pull starts from an elevated position. These are performed in a higher rep range to emphasize a loaded stretch in the traps, helping drive hypertrophy without over-fatiguing the lower back. You can choose to rotate between the two, stick with one, or decide based on how you\u2019re feeling that day\u2014this program encourages auto-regulation and flexibility.\n\nAfter the first movement, you transition into a bicep isolation exercise\u2014either Dumbbell Curls or Cable Curls\u2014to further target the arms early in the session. This is followed by a Vertical Press, using either a dumbbell or barbell, depending on preference. This is the primary overhead pressing movement of the day, though it\u2019s not the only shoulder-focused work included. You\u2019re given a flexible range of 3 to 5 sets for this movement, allowing you to nearly double your volume depending on your recovery and training goals.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll perform Bent-Over Lateral Raises to focus on the rear delts and upper back, providing balance to the pressing movements. Then move to Dumbbell or Cable Triceps Extensions, which are given the most set flexibility in the program\u2014up to 5 sets\u2014because triceps are a prioritized muscle group here. This allows you to adjust your training volume as needed while still supporting long-term arm development.\n\nTo wrap up the workout, you\u2019ll choose between Cable Rows for additional upper back volume or Dumbbell Bench Press if you\u2019d prefer to include more chest work. Both options are valid, and you\u2019re encouraged to decide on the day which one aligns best with your overall fatigue and training focus. There\u2019s even room to alternate both over time.\n\nFrom there, you\u2019ll include either Finger Curls for forearm emphasis or Hammer Curls for more biceps involvement, depending on which area you want to prioritize. The session finishes with Windshield Wipers performed for as many reps as possible, providing direct abdominal isolation to close out the workout with core training."

For this initial exercise, we're aiming for a higher rep range\u2014either 4 sets of 6-10 repetitions or 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions.\nAfter that, we'll move into some focused accessory work. For your calves, you'll do sitting calf raises. To hit your lats, we'll incorporate lat pulldowns. Then, for more posterior chain work, specifically targeting your hamstrings and glutes, you can choose between dumbbell hyperextensions or leg curls. To get more quad work in while also deloading your lower back and getting a good stretch on the quads, you'll perform either single-leg presses or split squats.

      "Optional_Notes":"We'll kick off this session with a hybrid press, such as an incline press or a Viking press. The aim here is to find a variation that effectively targets your chest without overly taxing your shoulders, as shoulder development is a high priority in this program. If chest work isn't a primary concern for you, the Viking press is an excellent choice. You could also opt for decline push-ups or handstand push-ups for as many reps as possible (AMRAP), which can also serve as a rotation option.\n\nFollowing that, we'll move to face pulls. Given the significant amount of shoulder training in this program, maintaining shoulder health is crucial. Direct external rotation from face pulls will help ensure your shoulders remain balanced, preventing an imbalance where your front delts become overly strong compared to your rear delts.\n\nNext up are weighted chin-ups. If you're not yet able to do them weighted, perform them for AMRAP. Alternatively, supinated lat pulldowns are a good substitute. For triceps, we'll hit skull crushers or French press. It's important not to neglect this portion of your triceps; while presses will engage them to some extent, they won't cover everything, and remember, triceps are a priority in this program.\n\nAfter that, you'll have another opportunity for chest development with chest flyes. If you'd rather focus more on biceps, you can do preacher curls instead. For this exercise, aim for a rep range of 8-20. This wider range is designed to allow you to handle the weights safely and effectively. Going too heavy here can be risky, as you'll likely be quite fatigued in both your chest and arms, leading to a rapid loss of muscular endurance in these movements.\n\nWe'll then move on to either upright rows or lateral raises. We'll finish the day with an abdominal isolation movement: leg raises for AMRAP.\n\nAs you can see, this program offers a lot of choices, giving you significant control over your volume. Even with higher rep ranges, the intensity remains relatively high."

These movements will contribute to more \"yoke\" and upper back development, while also engaging your posterior chain. Afterwards, you'll perform either GHR (Glute-Ham Raises) or snatch-grip hyperextensions. To further develop your forearms, we'll then add in towel grips.\n\nWe'll then move on to hack squats or leg presses. The goal here is to select any exercise that primarily biases the quadriceps and helps to deload your lower back. To completely finish off your upper back and \"yoke,\" you'll do either barbell snatch-grip shrugs or dumbbell shrugs, whichever you prefer.\n\nWe'll wrap up the day with some Captain of Crush work.

These movements effectively target your chest, shoulders, and triceps, and notably, this is the only horizontal press in the entire program. As an alternative, you could also perform diamond push-ups.\n\nFollowing that, you'll move to seal rows or Pendlay rows. Then, since it's arm day, we'll transition into some direct arm work. For more advanced lifters, a good arm day often includes compound movements to maximize upper body volume. Here, your bicep movement will be barbell curls or EZ-bar curls, performed at a relatively high intensity for 4 sets of 6-10 repetitions. For triceps, you'll do triceps pushdowns.\n\nTo finish off the shoulder work, perform lateral raises for your side deltoids. After that, we'll incorporate more forearm work. This time, instead of static stretches, the focus will be on movements involving more elbow flexion, which will also potentially include some wrist flexion. This approach ensures more comprehensive forearm development and prevents neglect of these muscles. Specifically, pinwheel curls or towel curls will target the brachialis. This will be followed by reverse curls or supinated finger curls for more direct forearm work.\n\nFinally, the session concludes with an abdominal isolation movement: decline sit-ups for as many reps as possible (AMRAP)."

      "Optional_Notes":"Pull Day Number One is part of the mirror day structure, which includes two pull days, two push days, and two leg days. This first pull day commences with either a barbell row or a T-bar row, performed for 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. These exercises should be executed as full-body movements, avoiding excessive strictness or cheating, to ensure heavy involvement of the posterior chain, as they are fundamental compound movements for the entire back. Immediately following this, the program instructs to perform cable crunches or machine crunches for the abs, for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. For all back exercises, including rows, the use of straps is recommended to preserve grip strength, which will be essential for the subsequent extensive forearm work.\n\nThe next segment involves performing machine high rows or lat pulldowns, specifically targeting the teres major and minor, and the lats, for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. Subsequently, the program indicates to perform upright rows or Y-raises. These combinations are designed to be feasible within a typical gym setting, minimizing equipment access issues. While separating the exercises is permissible if necessary, it will extend the session duration. When executed as intended, these combinations are structured to not impair performance. This sequence provides substantial lat development, while the upright rows or Y-raises contribute additional traps and shoulder work. Adequate traps development is crucial for the target physique, and shoulder work is essential. If upright rows cause shoulder discomfort, Y-raises are a suitable alternative due to their low-impact nature.\n\nFollowing this, neck extensions, which represent the first iteration of neck volume for this day, are performed for 3 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions. This is then succeeded by a sequence of three exercises. For curls, the instruction is to choose between dumbbell curls, barbell curls, EZ-bar curls, or cable curls. This introduces the principle of mirror lifts, where, from given options (e.g., \"dumbbell, barbell, EZ-bar, or cable curls\"), one exercise is selected. While flexibility to change the chosen lift exists, it is recommended to select one to begin with for Pull Day 1 and adhere to it initially. Pull Day 2 will offer an additional choice between two bicep exercises, allowing for up to four distinct bicep exercises across the two pull days. This provides significant variation, beneficial for continuous progression. New lifts should only be introduced when necessary for progression, with a preference for sticking to fewer exercises if effective. As an intermediate program, utilizing more than one lift per muscle group is expected. This sequence then concludes with performing either Farmers carries, 3 sets of 30 meters, or shrugs. This option caters to individuals with higher energy levels who prefer moving heavy weight; shrugs are a proven alternative for trap and neck development if fatigue is a concern. Shrugs, whether with dumbbells or a barbell, are executed for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions."

The selection of lift is based on individual preference; while both can be performed, it is recommended to focus on mastering one initially, for 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. Following this, perform rear delt rows or reverse Pec Deck, which provides additional upper back and traps work, along with direct rear delt stimulation. Performance should not significantly decline from starting with a press, as these movements specifically target the rear delts, not the front. These exercises are performed for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. This sequence collectively serves as the primary horizontal press, comprehensively engaging the chest.\n\nNext, transition to a vertical press targeting the shoulders: overhead press or military press, depending on a preference for seated or standing presses, performed for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. Immediately after this, execute hammer curls or reverse curls, selecting the lift that best aligns with individual needs for biceps or brachioradialis development, also for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions.\n\nThe session concludes with a series of exercises performed in sequence: cable lateral raises or bulldozer lateral raises, for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, providing further shoulder isolation. This is directly followed by crossbody extensions or katana extensions for the long head of the triceps, for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. Finally, an additional chest exercise that minimizes shoulder stimulation is performed: cable chest flies or Pec Deck, for 4 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This final chest exercise is included to complement the initial compound press."

This is followed by face pulls or power raises, targeting shoulders, rear delts, and traps, for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.\n\nNext, the program includes either Kroc rows (for traps, lats, and upper back) or Meadows rows. Both variations are effective and can be alternated weekly without disrupting progression due to their similar muscle targeting. These are performed for 4 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions. Immediately following, perform GZ neck raises, neck curls, or pronation twists, specifically for forearm development, for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. It is essential to use straps for Kroc rows or Meadows rows to ensure grip strength is preserved for subsequent forearm development exercises.\n\nThe overall structure of this session, a proper back day, centers on one vertical pull, one horizontal pull, and one shrug pattern. This volume is ample when executed intensely, contributing to significant back development with two such days per week. Following these back exercises, perform preacher curls (dumbbell or EZ-bar) or incline curls. The rep range for these is 3 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions. This wide rep range is a strategic mechanism to facilitate progression: by allowing drops to the lower end of the range (6 reps), it becomes easier to increase weight, accumulate reps, and build up to the higher end (12 reps) before progressing in weight again, thus preventing plateaus and ensuring continuous growth."

Immediately following this, execute neck flexions or extensions, representing the third iteration of neck volume for the week; the specific exercise choice should target the area desired for most development, for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.\n\nSubsequently, perform converging chest press (utilizing any preferred chest machine) or weighted push-ups, for 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This is then followed by decline sit-ups or dragon flags for abdominal work, for 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. This day commences with a hybrid press that engages both shoulders and primarily the chest and upper chest. A compound chest exercise is then included, limited to three sets to maintain freshness and intensity. The session will conclude with additional exercises, which will be detailed separately."

      "Optional_Notes":"This second leg day is designed to deliver high returns with minimal volume, especially as you approach the end of a training cycle when fatigue is at its peak. The goal is not to bury you under excessive work, but to get the most out of every set.\n\nStart with Romanian deadlifts or good mornings. These movements heavily target the posterior chain\u2014glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. Perform just two sets of 6\u201312 reps. There's no need for more volume here; you can make excellent progress with high-quality effort in just two sets.\n\nNext, move to either dumbbell rear delt swings or incline dumbbell shrugs. Again, perform two sets of 8\u201312 reps. This targets either the rear delts or traps. At this point in the program, your fatigue is likely peaking, so select the movement based on what you can execute with solid form. Rear delt work is optional if you're unable to perform it effectively; however, trap work tends to recover more easily and is generally manageable.\n\nAfter that, perform Smith machine squats or leg press for three sets of 8\u201312 reps. These options are chosen specifically to reduce lower back fatigue while still challenging the quads. In contrast to traditional barbell squats, these movements offload the lower back, helping to preserve your pulling capacity for deadlift-focused days.\n\nThen, complete calf raises using the same machine you used for the quad movement\u2014either Smith machine standing calf raises or leg press calf raises, depending on your setup. Perform three sets of 10\u201315 reps. The idea is to simplify transitions and reduce setup time while still hitting the calves effectively.\n\nTo round out the posterior chain, include glute-ham raises (GHR) or Nordic hamstring curls for three sets of 10\u201315 reps. This helps ensure comprehensive hamstring and glute development without overloading the lower back.\n\nFinally, the session ends with forearm and grip work. Perform dead hangs for three sets of one minute. Dead hangs are deceptively taxing, particularly on the forearms, so they should be kept brief and focused. As an alternative or follow-up, use a wrist roller for extension work\u2014roll the weight outward to train wrist extension, a movement pattern often neglected in favor of wrist flexion. Strengthening wrist extensors not only improves forearm balance and aesthetics but also protects elbow health over time."

The chosen exercise is performed for 4 sets of 4 to 10 repetitions, allowing for exposure to both low and higher rep ranges. This is followed immediately by dumbbell or machine rows, focused on developing the upper back without excessive lower back involvement, for 4 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions. This initial sequence reflects the program's intensity and priority hierarchy.\n\nNext, perform barbell, dumbbell, or machine overhead press for shoulder development, for 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This is followed by dumbbell or EZ-bar curls for biceps, for 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. After this, perform decline sit-ups for abs, for 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. This sequence demonstrates a progression from high-intensity, compound movements to less intense isolation work, managing fatigue effectively across the exercises. After completing this entire sequence, a rest period of three to four minutes is advised before repeating the sequence, starting again with the high-intensity overhead movement.\n\nThe Monday session concludes with cable flies or bent-over Pec Deck for the chest, focusing on stretch, for 4 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions, using a relatively light weight. This is followed by upright rows or lateral raises, based on preference, for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, to comprehensively train the shoulders. Excess volume beyond this point would be considered inefficient. The final exercise for this sequence is reverse or hammer curls for additional forearm work, for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, also contributing to bicep involvement. This day targets all key upper body muscles, positioned on Monday when the individual is typically at their freshest, followed by 48 hours of recovery before the next session."

      "Optional_Notes":"Wednesday's session is a lower body focus. It begins with either barbell or Zercher squats (Zercher for more upper back development, barbell for pure quad\/hamstring\/posterior chain focus), or any preferred knee flexion exercise. This main lift is performed for 3 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions, aiming for quality and volume. As an alternative for knee flexion, belt squats or hack squats\/leg presses can be performed for 4 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions, which incur less systemic fatigue and allow for more quad targeting. Rotation between these options is also possible. Immediately following the main lift, perform neck extensions for 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. This non-strenuous exercise is critical for neck isolation and development.\n\nNext, perform Romanian deadlifts or block pulls for posterior chain or upper back development, respectively, for 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. These can be rotated weekly for program flexibility. This is followed by behind-the-back cable curls for bicep isolation, focusing on the stretched position with a lighter weight, for 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. Then, perform seated calf raises for 3 to 4 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions, adding minor calf stimulation.\n\nFollowing this, perform lat pulldowns, 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, or weighted pull-ups, 4 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions. Prioritizing weighted pull-ups is recommended for overall upper back development. This sequence is important and should not be skipped. After this, perform dumbbell or upper chest shrugs (shrug variations) for development without taxing the lower back, for 4 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions. The session concludes with French press or behind-the-head cable extension for long head triceps development, for 4 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. While long head triceps may not be a primary aesthetic focus, its development can enhance bicep appearance. This upper\/lower session is designed to induce significant fatigue, which is conducive to muscle growth."

      "Optional_Notes":"The Friday full body session strategically spares muscles heavily taxed earlier in the week (e.g., biceps, chest) to allow focus on other areas that are still fresh. It commences with an incline press or a Viking press. If the chest retains freshness, an incline press is suitable; otherwise, a Viking press or any vertical press is an option for shoulder focus, as shoulders would be recovered from the lower body day. This exercise is performed for 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions. This wide rep range allows for progressive overload through rep accumulation, spending more time with the same weight to adapt and maximize gains. Immediately following this, perform Kroc rows (focused on traps development) or dumbbell pullovers (for lats), for 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. Rotating between these two movements is highly recommended due to their effectiveness.\n\nNext, perform Farmers carries (if equipment is available) for 3 sets of 30 meters, or trap bar deadlifts (for quick recovery and posterior chain work without excessive lower back strain), for 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This program avoids maximal lifts (1-3 reps) as it prioritizes hypertrophy. After this, perform cable lateral raises for shoulder isolation, or incline cable flies for upper chest and chest development, for 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions.\n\nTo conclude the full body session, the program instructs to perform leg extensions or split squats for 4 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions, followed by pinwheel or hammer curls for 4 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions, and then neck flexions for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions.

Immediately following this, execute dumbbell or Meadows rows for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. This program consistently incorporates upper back work, with this sequence serving as a classic horizontal push followed by a pull.\n\nNext, transition to overhead pressing by performing dumbbell press or overhead press for 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. Directly after this, perform cable or dumbbell triceps extensions for 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. This pairing is designed to develop the shoulders and specifically target the long head of the triceps. Be assured that this sequence will not diminish performance. Consistent shoulder work is a core component of this program. While the program prioritizes optimal recovery, individuals experiencing shoulder discomfort, particularly from horizontal pressing movements like bench presses or dips, should modify exercises as needed. Vertical pressing, in contrast, tends to be less taxing on the shoulder joint and can even aid recovery.\n\nThe session continues with either dumbbell pullovers (to develop the lats, chest, and long head of the triceps) or lat pulldowns, both performed for 4 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. This offers flexibility to hit muscles similarly but with different movement patterns. Following this, perform neck curls for 4 sets of 15 to 20 repetitions.\n\nFinally, include rear delt rows for 4 sets of nucleus overload. Nucleus overload is a specific training method where a weight that can be easily lifted is chosen for a set number of repetitions, without reaching failure. It is designed to be low-fatigue and serves as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the primary, harder work for a given muscle group.

      "Optional_Notes":"For the Friday Lower Two session, begin with either squats or hack squats, performing 4 sets of 6 to 8 repetitions or 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions based on preference. Following this, perform hang power cleans or snatch-grip hang power cleans for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. These exercises effectively engage the calves and contribute to upper back development. The \"10 to 15\" repetition range signifies an evolving rep range, allowing for greater ability to reach muscular failure, maintain intensity, and promote consistent progression.\n\nNext, continue with either Romanian deadlifts or block pulls to target the posterior chain or upper back. This is followed by decline sit-ups for 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions. For Romanian deadlifts, perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, and for block pulls, perform 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions.\n\nThe session then concludes with a choice between hip thrusts or barbell hack squats, each performed for 4 sets, allowing for a focus on either quads or glutes. This is followed by power shrugs (for trap development) or Pendlay rows (for overall back development with less upper trap emphasis), both for 4 sets of 8 to 10 repetitions. Finally, the session concludes with shrugs performed for nucleus overload. The logic here is that if the shoulders are primarily targeted earlier in the day, the session ends with rear delt nucleus overload; if the traps are emphasized, the session concludes with shrugs for nucleus overload, capitalizing on prior muscle fatigue."

      "Muscle_Volume":"Front Delts - 3, Side Delts - 3, Biceps - 8, Triceps - 8, Forearms - 8",
      "Optional_Notes":"The program concludes with an arm day on Saturday, following a training schedule of Monday, Tuesday, then rest on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and training again on Saturday. The Saturday session is designed to induce peak fatigue. Sunday serves as a rest day before the commencement of a new weekly cycle on Monday. This is a high-frequency program where daily training volume is moderate but compounds across the week, making effective recovery and volume management crucial for sustained progression.\n\nThe Saturday session functions as an arm-focused recovery day, intentionally minimizing work on legs, posterior chain, and upper back. This day primarily involves chest work to some extent, with the majority of exercises being isolation movements. This structure results in extremely low nervous system fatigue. This approach promotes recovery, allowing for substantial limb and arm development while ensuring the individual is fresh for the Monday session's compound movements.\n\nThe Saturday arm day commences with a primary pressing movement. Select either Viking press, landmine press, or incline press. Perform 3 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions. This targets either the shoulders or chest. Following this, execute cable lateral raises for 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions, providing shoulder isolation. Next, select EZ-bar curls or EZ-bar preacher curls, performing 4 sets of 8 to 10 repetitions. Continue with crossbody or Katana triceps extensions for 4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions, targeting the long head of the triceps. Then, perform hammer or towel curls (where a towel is wrapped around a plate for curls) for 4 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. This is followed by triceps pushdowns for 4 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions, and finger curls for 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. This session concludes with isolated forearm and tricep work. Nucleus overload is not applied on this day, preserving freshness for the next training week. Across the entire program, burnout sets are systematically replaced by nucleus overload."

You have been trained on comprehensive datasets, including:

- Volume benchmarks (MV, MEV, MRV) for various muscle groups, outlining the minimum, effective, and maximum recoverable volumes.
- High-level program overviews, detailing program themes (e.g., anime characters), general volume allocation, and narrative notes on program philosophy.
- Detailed workout session meta-data, including exercises per session, derived muscle volume, and notes on substitutions or rotation logic.
- An extensive exercise details database, covering specific exercise names, set counts, rep ranges, and alternate exercise options.

Your task is to generate a complete weekly workout plan based *only* on the user's provided number of training days (between 3-6) and their chosen prioritized muscle groups (strong points).

You are solely responsible for the following:

1. **Inferring Muscle Group Status:** Logically infer neutral and weak muscle groups based on the chosen strong points, adhering to the patterns observed in your training data.
2. **Volume Distribution:** Distribute training volume accordingly: high for strong points (approaching MRV), moderate for neutral points (around MEV), and minimal for weak points (closer to MV or MEV for maintenance/minor stimulus).
3. **Weekly Training Split:** Construct a full, coherent weekly training split across the specified number of days.
4. **Exercise Detailing:** Ensure every exercise entry includes:
    - "Name": The exercise name.
    - "Sets": The number of sets.
    - "Reps": The rep range (e.g., "4-8", "AMRAP", "ALAP").
    - (Optional) "Alternates": An array of alternate exercises, if relevant, with their own "Name", "Sets", and "Reps".
5. **Adherence to Natural Hypertrophy Philosophy:**
    - **NO SUPERSETS.** This is a strict rule.
    - Sessions must be organized around focused regions or movement patterns.
    - Variability in lifts or substitutions is allowed but must be clearly structured and separate.
    - The overall tone must be instructional, patient, and rationale-driven, as seen in Natural Hypertrophy content.
6. **Comprehensive Session Notes:** For each `Workout_Day`, provide detailed and informative `Notes` that clearly explain:
    - The rationale behind the exercise selection and order, emphasizing how it targets the prioritized muscle groups.
    - How the overall volume and focus are distributed to support strong points while balancing neutral and weak muscle groups.
    - Any guidance on technique, progression, or potential exercise substitutions.
    - Additional context to help the user understand the programming philosophy and maximize their training outcomes for that session.
7. **Strict JSON Output Format:** You **must** return the generated plan in the following exact JSON structure. Do not include any conversational text or explanation outside of this JSON block once you start generating it.
